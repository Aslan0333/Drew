Hi jhazz, 
I'll be honest here, I just want to say this to you that I like you, i really like you. I like you more than just a friend. I don't know, but this feelings was very unexpected. I don't know how i fell inlove with you, but i feel this thing that you made me feel fall inlove again, you made me feel loved, cared, special, and appreciated once in my life and now i felt how it feels. But i guess this feelings should stop there, as i think that what i felt may not be the same on how you feel about me. And i guess that my feelings for you should not exceed beyond our friendship. Sorry if sometime you feel that I'm ignoring you, it was just my way to lose my feelings to you, as my feelings is getting deeper and deeper when im interacting with you. I can't risk what we have and i don't want to expect you to reciprocate my feelings. I can't keep it anymore but i have no choice but to say this to you.
 Thank you for listening.
Hope you understand it.

        <p> Thank you.
